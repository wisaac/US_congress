Foley, first elected in 1964, represented the Fifth District of Washington State for 30 years. Born on March 6, 1929, in Spokane, WA, the son of Judge Ralph and Helen Foley, he grew up in an atmosphere rich with politics (his father was an elected state superior court judge for a record 35 years) that included dinner conversations with then-Senator Henry M. (Scoop) Jackson. Certainly, his father Ralph was an enormous influence on Mr. Foley and inspired the evenhandedness and judicial nature that marked his long career in Congress. Following the wishes of his father, a respected judge and former prosecutor, Mr. Foley graduated from Gonzaga Prep and attended Spokane's Gonzaga University. After several years at GU, he transferred to the University of Washington from which he received a bachelor of arts degree and moved on to graduate from UW's law school in 1957. After completing law school, he returned to Spokane, practiced law, and then joined the Spokane County Prosecutor's Office. About that time of his life, he said ``I had more power as a prosecutor than at any other period in my life.'' Mr. Foley also taught constitutional law at Gonzaga University Law School in Spokane. It gave him a basis for understanding the provisions of the Constitution and the reasons for each provision. In 1960 he joined the State of Washington Attorney General's Office. In 1961 in a major career change he moved to Washington, DC, to become a special counsel to Senator Jackson, a rising political and institutional power in the Senate and chairman of the Senate Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs. In 1964 Senator Jackson recruited four young political aspirants to run for the House in Washington State. It was a national landslide year for Democrats. All of Senator Jackson's choices won; Tom Foley's narrow victory over a 22-year incumbent was by far the most surprising. Mr. Foley's career in public service was influenced by his father's traits of courtesy, patience, and a sense of public responsibility. But in 1965 little did anyone know that the urbane 6&#127;4"" young lawyer from Spokane would emerge as a leading voice of congressional reform and a champion of the integrity of the U.S. Constitution. His rise up the ladder in what was a very tradition-laden House was aided by his uncommon ability to forge a following from southern conservatives, westerners, and urban liberals. Contrary to the public perceptions about politicians, Tom Foley was always a kind man who never spoke badly about anyone either publicly or privately. He was almost saintly in this respect, as though he had taken a vow to always see the positive in people. He thought more was to be gained in both life and politics by listening and respecting differences. Assigned to the House Committee on Agriculture when he was sworn in as a Congressman, and becoming its chairman in 1975, Mr. Foley took a strong interest in the problems of hunger across the United States. The Committee on Agriculture was and remained for years a political bastion of southern and rural conservatives whose main interests were crops and livestock. In the late 1960s, when medical teams reported widespread hunger and malnutrition in very poor parts of the country, especially among children, Mr. Foley led House efforts to expand and improve the then-very-small food stamp and nutrition programs, greatly expanding and spreading them nationwide. He built bipartisan House support for these reforms and worked with Senators Robert Dole and George McGovern to pass a battery of measures in the 1970s that transformed food stamps. In the late 1970s medical teams returned to very poor areas of the country and reported dramatic reductions in hunger and the near-elimination of childhood diseases caused by malnutrition. They credited the reforms Mr. Foley and his Senate allies had engineered as the pivotal factor behind the improvements. ``He was a giant,'' noted Robert Greenstein, president of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, who headed the food stamp program in the Carter administration and worked closely with Mr. Foley. He combined intense knowledge of the program and ways to strengthen it with a keen sense of political strategy. In addition, he was deeply respected by both sides of the aisle in a way that was unusual then and is even more unusual today. He drew on all of these skills to craft and pass legislation that has helped tens of millions of low- income Americans. Despite representing a giant wheat producing district in a politically conservative stretch of America, Tom Foley became a champion of civil liberties and respect for the Constitution. He engineered the defeat of an anti-flag burning constitutional amendment and worked to prevent other amendments he thought harmful to the Constitution such as prayer in the public schools and term limits for Members of Congress. Tom Foley believed the Constitution was very clear in its intent and that voters had an opportunity every 2 years to limit the term of any incumbent of the House or Senate running for reelection. Although his views were validated by the Supreme Court (U.S. Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton), the fact that he publicly became involved in a lawsuit to declare the State of Washington's term limits unconstitutional was politically unpopular at home. His willingness to take political risks on a point of constitutional principle came to play a role in his defeat for reelection in 1994. Mr. Foley's prominence in the leading internal reform organization of the House, the Democratic Study Group, did not prevent Majority Leader Jim Wright from naming him majority whip, third in command of the House majority. Mr. Foley was a continuation of a remarkable run of Irish Americans in the leadership of the House. Like Tip O'Neill, he was a large and formidable figure with a bottomless well of humorous stories that served to break political tensions and bring people to negotiations that helped move the institution forward. It was at this time that Mr. Foley had a chance to display his remarkable skills in foreign affairs. He became Mr. O'Neill's point man on the contentious issues of Northern Ireland and in bringing about a bipartisan show of support for the Reagan administration's invasion of Grenada. Foreign policy issues, whether about the policy or the process, increasingly drew Mr. Foley's attention. He was a prominent figure in the anti-Contra furor in the House and opposed the first Iraq war. Ireland was also never far from his mind, and he was inspired by the political bravery of John Hume, later a Nobel Peace Prize winner. Mr. Foley steadily worked for peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland throughout his speakership. His interest in foreign affairs was never far from the surface and ultimately resulted in his being the only Member of the House who was awarded the highest honors from the most important U.S. allies: Great Britain made him a Commander of the British Empire; Germany gave him its Order of Merit; France conveyed membership in the Legion of Honor; and Japan awarded him the Order of the Rising Sun with Paulownia Flowers, Grand Cordon. House leaders and Members increasingly respected the political skills of their whip and former caucus chair. He became a fixture at Democratic conventions, serving as parliamentarian until he himself became chairman of the convention in 1992 when Bill Clinton was nominated for his first term. Ever faithful to a major wheat producing constituency, Mr. Foley was an unusual Democrat because he was a steady supporter of trade liberalization and became essential in ensuring significant Democratic support for trade bills that might otherwise have been defeated. He will be most remembered in this respect for moving the North America Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) through a contentious Congress. Tom Foley seemed to move naturally to issues revolving around the budget. In 1987, after being elected majority leader, he became a member of the House Budget Committee. Beginning with the Black Friday stock market crash during the Reagan administration, Mr. Foley was present in every negotiation designed to avoid the prolonged standoff that now exists. He became closely involved with these issues initially when he led the House negotiators in responding to the issues associated with the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act and ultimately obtaining an agreement on that complicated and controversial proposal. In 1987 Tom Foley chaired the negotiations between the Congress and the Reagan administration to respond to the Black Friday stock market crash. Working with then- Secretary of the Treasury James A. Baker III and others, that group under Tom Foley's leadership came to a consensus that eased the markets and helped strengthen the economy. Mr. Foley was an active participant in the 1990 budget summit negotiations on Capitol Hill. At Andrews Air Force Base it was his leadership that brought the eight leaders together to work out the final agreement that the Congress subsequently passed. Mr. Foley led the House of Representatives during the first 2 years of President Bill Clinton's first term. The 1993 economic plan approved under his leadership arguably was important in enhancing the country's economy and moving toward a balanced budget. Like Mr. O'Neill, Tom Foley believed that the perfect should not get in the way of the achievable. He was part of the political generation influenced by the Presidency of Lyndon Johnson and the view that half of something was better than none. There was always another day and another Congress to move forward and get the other half done. A man not prone to public anger, he reserved his passions for things he thought essential to the continuation of a just and prosperous nation. Hunger in all its forms, oppression through government rules, and tinkering with the Constitution to satisfy temporary political uproar went against the grain. He was a man who could bring a world's fair to Spokane (Expo 74), which attracted 5.2 million visitors; promote a huge third power house to Grand Coulee Dam (at that time Grand Coulee became the largest hydrodam in the United States); and successfully fight the FDA and the movie industry on issues important to the common man. Mr. Foley never deviated from the idea that you fought for people who went to work every day and kept faith in a just nation, just as his grandfather did in the Spokane rail boiler shops at the turn of the previous century. Tom Foley's views on the responsibility of a House Member never changed. After his defeat in 1994, he noted: I've taken positions that I think were damaging in a political sense, but I don't have any regrets taking them. I used to say that the most important thing about votes on the floor and positions you take in Congress is that when you consider them at election time you're able to say with some satisfaction that you can still vote for yourself. Mr. Foley's 30 years in office involved 15 campaigns for election. Some he won by large margins and others were uncomfortably close. After surviving the Reagan landslide of 1980, he did not retreat to the insular politics of staying close to home. Rather, he took on more political risk. Upon becoming the majority whip he had to give up his Agriculture Committee chairmanship and use his legislative skills to help lead the national Democratic Party and support the policy agenda of the Clinton Presidency, which he did faithfully. But, unlike the 1980 election he could not hold onto an increasingly conservative and Republican district. As the Democrats lost the majority in the House in 1994 so too did he closely lose his seat as the Representative from the Fifth District of Washington State. Mr. Foley saw the future, not in lobbying, but in trying to stay involved in broad policy questions and foreign affairs. He became a counsel to the prominent Washington law firm of Akin Gump Strauss Hauer &amp; Feld and chairman of President Clinton's Intelligence Advisory Board. In 1997 President Clinton named Tom Foley as the U.S. Ambassador to Japan. Mr. Foley knew Japan well, having traveled there every year he served in Congress, becoming close to Japanese leaders, politicians, academics, and businessmen. He was particularly fascinated by the courtesies inherent in Japanese culture and developed a deep respect for the country's traditions and customs. Accordingly, he was widely respected by the Japanese public and in 2001 the new administration of President Bush asked him to stay on to handle the public affairs disaster that occurred when a U.S. submarine accidentally sank the Ehime Maru, a Japanese fishery high school training ship in Honolulu's harbor. Tom Foley left Tokyo in March 2001, returned to Akin Gump, and became North American chairman of the Trilateral Commission of which he had a been a longtime member. Illness forced him to leave both positions in 2008. He is survived by his wife, the former Heather Strachan, to whom he was married on December 19, 1968, and his sister Maureen Latimer, her husband Richard Latimer of Santa Rosa, CA, and their children Elizabeth Ann Garbocci of Ukiah, CA; Kathleen Ely of Martinez, CA; Carolyn Latimer of Santa Rosa, CA; John Latimer of Elk Grove, CA; and Mark Latimer of Petaluma, CA. ? MEMORIAL ADDRESSES AND OTHER TRIBUTES FOR THOMAS S. FOLEY Proceedings in the House of Representatives Tuesday, October 22, 2013 PRAYER The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following prayer: Almighty God, we give You thanks for giving us another day. As the People's House returns, we give You thanks for those most responsible for the resolutions reached this past week and for the reopening of government, which has meant so much to the families of those who have chosen to serve their Nation by their work in government. As all return, the Capitol is in mourning for the loss of two men of the House, former Speaker Tom Foley and Representative Bill Young. Both men, a Democrat and a Republican, were known to be giants in the People's House, and their passing has deprived our Nation of experience and wisdom in Congress at a time when it is needed.

His career in public service dates back to 1963 when he was appointed assistant attorney general for the State of Ohio. He later served as a State representative, Cuyahoga County commissioner, county auditor, and Lieutenant Governor of the State of Ohio. In 1979, he was elected mayor of Cleveland, serving for 10 years, and in 1990 he was elected Governor of Ohio and served for two terms. George Voinovich is the only person to have served as chairman of the National Governors Association and president of the National League of Cities. In 1998, he was elected to the U.S. Senate and was reelected to a second term in 2004. As mayor, George Voinovich helped turn Cleveland around after it became the first major city to declare bankruptcy since the Depression. As Governor, he led Ohio through the early 1990s recession.

									 - LEGISLATIVE HEARING ON H.R. 4791, THREE DRAFT BILLS, AND A PROPOSED AMENDMENT TO H.R. 3082 THURSDAY, APRIL 27, 2006 U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, SUBCOMMITTEE ON ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY, COMMITTEE ON VETERANS' AFFAIRS, Washington, D.C. The Subcommittee met, pursuant to call, at 1:36 p.m., in Room 334, Cannon House Office Building, Hon. John Boozman [Chairman of the Subcommittee] presiding. Present: Representatives Boozman, Brown-Waite, Herseth, and Hooley. MR. BOOZMAN. The meeting will be in order. Today we are going to receive testimony on two bills, an amendment for H.R. 3082 and H.R. 4791, as well as three draft bills. The proposed amendment is for bill I introduced earlier in the session, H.R. 3082, and would provide new tools and procedures for VA contracting officers to enable them to do more business with veteran and disabled veteran entrepreneurs and put veteran businesses at the head of the line for small business set- asides. Given this new set of acquisition tools, there will be no reason for VA not to meet the veteran and service-disabled veteran small business contracting goals. I expect the Department to make a significant effort to ensure that its contracting officers understand that we are serious about this and are giving them a chance to perform. H.R. 4791 is Ms. Herseth's bill to increase Adapted Housing Grant amounts, and I will recognize her in a moment to explain its provisions. One draft bill focuses on improving the State Grant Program for Disabled Veterans Outreach Program Specialists and Local Veteran Employment Representatives by setting hiring and retention guidelines, improving reporting of employment data, setting certain requirements for grants, implementing a pilot contract program in areas of high veteran unemployment, and revising the current Incentive Award Program. Another draft proposed by Ms. Brown-Waite seeks to improve licensing and certification for those coming out of the military. And I will also ask her to explain her bill. Finally, we have a draft bill to begin the process of modernizing the GI Bill Education Benefit Program. One of the things we have found is that about 30 percent of veterans never use their educational benefit because they do not want to attend traditional degree programs or cannot spend two to four years in schools because of circumstances. Therefore, the draft focuses on improving the usefulness of the GI Bill for the 30 percent of veterans who do not use the program by increasing the types of training courses eligible for accelerated benefits. The draft also improves work study, equalized monthly payments for certain students, and requires VA to provide a report on streamlining administration. I feel strongly that many of the restrictive rules and regulations in the current program need to be eliminated or significantly modified where possible as long as we do not open the program to waste, fraud, and abuse. I take Mr. Steve Kime's observation at our Arkansas field hearing to heart that current rules and regulations treat all schools and veterans like potential lawbreakers. We spend so much time and resources trying to screen out possible problems that we negatively impact service to our veterans. And certainly it is not right to go too far. That situation is not a good situation. We can use technology to maintain the integrity of the program, improve timeliness, education benefits for prime candidates, for rules-based processing. And I intend to have a conversation with VA leadership about increasing the investment in that type of information technology to speed up processing. Regarding the Draft Education Bill, I felt we needed to begin exploring ideas and potential cost. And I want to make sure that everyone understands that it is not a finished product by any means. The eventual changes will likely cost a significant amount of money and we must do this right to get the most effective use of taxpayer funds. I understand the DoD/VA GI Bill Working Group will report to the Joint Executive Council in July, and the Armed Services Committee is also taking a hard look at the issue. We will work with the VA/DoD Working Group not for the quickest change but for the best. I now recognize our Ranking Member, Ms. Herseth, for her opening remarks. MS. HERSETH. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. Good afternoon to you and to those who have joined us today. I want to thank you for holding this legislative hearing. I very much appreciate your efforts as I have stated in the past, but I do not think it can be stated often enough of your willingness and the work of our staffs to conduct our Subcommittee in a very bipartisan and effective manner. I also appreciate your flexibility in scheduling that allows us to attempt to participate in all of the events that we have going on throughout the week when we are in session. Like you, Mr. Chairman, I also want to welcome the witnesses today and look forward to receiving their views and insights and responses to some of our questions on the many bills we have before the Subcommittee. I am particularly pleased that we have included in today's agenda House Resolution 4791, the Disabled Veterans Adapted Housing Improvement Act, a bill that I introduced along with a number of my colleagues earlier this year. The bill would increase the amounts available for adapted housing grants for certain disabled veterans. It would also establish an index that reflects a uniform national average annual increase in the cost of residential home construction so that the future disabled veterans eligible for this grant would continue to maintain their purchasing power. Additionally, I am pleased we are examining other measures aimed at enhancing the VA's ability to contract with veteran-owned small business owners and improving employment services and job training opportunities for veterans seeking employment and providing more flexibility to the Montgomery GI Bill. Nearly 200,000 servicemembers separate from military service each year. These men and women who have given their best in defense of the nation deserve our best efforts here in the Congress. Indeed, after protecting and sustaining our freedom and our way of life, they and their families have earned the right to live the American dream. And many of these initiatives that we will be talking about today facilitate the ability to meet and live that dream. So, Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the witnesses' views and their efforts to assist us in crafting effective legislation. I know that we will use the testimony to guide us in making some helpful and reasonable improvements in the measures before us. So thank you, and I yield back. MR. BOOZMAN. Thank you. Ms. Hooley. MS. HOOLEY. Thank you, Mr. Chair and Ranking Member, for holding these hearings today. I, too, am excited about the legislation that is before us. And since my election, one of my priorities have been to make sure that veterans and their spouses get what they so richly deserve. I really believe the federal government has a debt of honor to pay back all the veterans and I will continue to fight to make sure that American veterans receive the benefits which they so clearly deserve in return for their service to the nation and its people. The bills we are considering today are important and they are common-sense measures that will not only improve the lives of our veterans but keep the promise our nation made to take care of them. Proposals like increasing benefits for our disabled veterans to adapt their houses to fit their needs, very important, or initiatives to help veterans with their employment, be it a veteran-owned small business trying to get its foot in the door or placement programs for disabled veterans. But I am particularly pleased to see the Subcommittee considering draft legislation that would provide great flexibility to our veterans as they use our education benefits that they have earned under the Montgomery GI Bill. Too many of our veterans find claiming and using their earned education benefits to be a cumbersome process filled with red tape, and this draft legislation will hopefully make it a little a little easoier for them to get the education they need. However, there is one issue, and I hope both the Chair and the Ranking Member pay attention, that has not been addressed. It is something I believe to be a harsh penalty upon our veterans and I hope it can be fixed. Under current law, once a soldier has been separated from service, he or she only has ten years to use that education benefit or they lose it. I do not think this is right. It is a program that they paid into and they cannot reclaim their own money if they do not enroll in school before the ten years are up. Currently only 57 percent of soldiers who pay into the GI Bill Fund actually use their earned education benefits within that time frame. And what I found is there are some young people that have come back from the service and in some cases, they need help. They do not know what they are going to do. They do not know where they are going. Sometimes they have mental health problems. Sometimes they have drug problems. And at about 30, they decide, gee, I think I want to go back to school only to find out they cannot use the benefits. So I think something is wrong with that system, and hopefully we will look at that in this particular piece of legislation. And, again, I think these veterans should be able to reclaim their education benefits whenever they are ready to attend school and it is long past the time to repeal this outdated ten- year limit. Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Herseth, I look forward to working with both of you to address this issue as we continue to look at ways to make the GI Bill more flexible and education benefits more accessible to our veterans, and look forward to our panel today. Thank you. MR. BOOZMAN. Thank you, Ms. Hooley. And we certainly were paying attention. MS. HOOLEY. Okay. MR. BOOZMAN.

									 - CORPORATE COMMITMENT TO HIRING VETERANS WEDNESDAY, APRIL 26, 2006 U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, COMMITTEE ON VETERANS' AFFAIRS, Washington, D.C. The Committee met, pursuant to call, at 10:30 a.m., in Room 334, Cannon House Office Building, Hon. Steve Buyer [Chairman of the Committee] presiding. Present: Representatives Buyer, Filner, Michaud, Boozman, Campbell, Udall, Herseth, Snyder, Salazar, Reyes. THE CHAIRMAN. The House Committee on Veterans' Affairs will come to order, the date is April 26, 2006. The purpose of this hearing is to provide companies which have succeeded in hiring veterans an opportunity to discuss their successful practices and methods in hiring veterans. Veterans make good employees and that includes veterans who have been severely injured in service. That is why we have invited several companies to show why their programs to hire veterans are industry leaders. Some of America's finest are now residing at Walter Reed, Bethesda, Brook, and other military and VA hospitals where they are recovering from their injuries and wounds, and they are going to be looking for employment in the future. To our newest heros, let me express on behalf of the whole Committee our great admiration for your sacrifice and the courage you show in working through your rehabilitation. I hope that each of you will understand we are committed to ensuring that you have the means to support yourselves when you leave service. We will hear today from your fellow veterans and industry leaders. Each of you faces a challenge. We will help you conquer that challenge by offering you the opportunity to qualify for a good job, not just because you have a Purple Heart, but because you can do the job. In a sense your predecessors who will speak today speak on your behalf. They and thousands of others have broken a trail for you and I encourage you, each of you, to give a maximum effort to follow their footsteps. The companies represented here today, I wish you a warm welcome and extend my thanks for stepping up to the plate when it comes to hiring America's veterans. You are setting the standard by which to measure the nation's business community. I also want to acknowledge the staff of the magazine GI Jobs for identifying those companies with superior performance in hiring America's veterans. Publications such as GI Jobs are a tremendous resource in spreading the word that hiring veterans makes good business sense. Before we proceed with the first panel, I want to extend my expression of personal respect for our Ranking Member Lane Evans. Unfortunately, Lane could not be here with us today, but I feel it is appropriate to say despite his absence, that Lane has announced his retirement, and I believe it is important to recognize him for his 24 years of remarkable service to this nation as a member of the House of Representatives and as a United States Marine. His work here reflects the principles that have guided him throughout his career. Lane's concern for our military men and women, the environment, and those less fortunate speaks to his character and his commitment to make life better. But it is his unwavering support of the nation's veterans that best describes his time in Congress. Agent Orange, PTSD, spina bifida, and expanded services for women veterans are just some of the causes for which Lane will be fondly remembered by his colleagues. I also have served on the Armed Services Committee with Lane and always respected his work there, and I am especially appreciative of his counsel as the Ranking Member of the House Veterans' Affairs Committee. Even if we sometimes do disagree on policy matters, I never doubted his initiatives on veterans' matters are rooted in his service as a United States Marine in the Vietnam era. Lane is a man of integrity, compassion, and honor, and I will miss him when we convene the 110th Congress. Lane, it has been my privilege to serve with you and I wish you the fair winds and following seas. I now recognize Mr. Michaud for an opening statement. MR. MICHAUD. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I want to thank you for having this hearing. I also want to thank both panels for your time coming out to talk to this Committee as well as for all that you do for our veterans throughout the nation. I really appreciate that. I am looking forward to your testimony. I also want to reiterate what the Chairman had stated about Ranking Member Lane Evans who has been a strong advocate for veterans for a number of years. He is a mentor and I know I will definitely miss him in the 110th Congress. With that, Mr. Chairman, I wish to submit the remainder of my remarks for the record. THE CHAIRMAN. So ordered. THE CHAIRMAN. Mr. Michaud, gentlemen, is also the Ranking Member on the Health Subcommittee. The members of our first panel represent some of the companies who make a commitment to hiring those who wear the uniform in the service of our country. Too often companies get bashed for not being ""veteran friendly enough."" Today we have with us companies that have made an effort to seek out veterans because they know the skills, the attitude, and the character they bring to the workplace. I will call all of you the pace setters. First, we will hear from Mr. Dennis Donovan. He joined Home Depot in April 2001 as the Executive Vice President of Human Resources. He has served on numerous human resource councils and round-tables. He was elected as a fellow in the National Academy of Human Resources, an honor considered the most prestigious in the field of human resources. He currently serves on the Academy's Board of Directors and was also named Human Resources Executive of the Year by the Human Resources Executive Magazine. We will then hear next from Mr. William J. Behrendt who currently serves as the Assistant Vice President of Human Resources for Union Pacific Railroad. He has been with Union Pacific since 1979 and has worked in all areas of human resources. He has been responsible for hiring since 1999. We will then hear from Mr. Marc Chini who was named Vice President of Human Resources for General Electric Infrastructure in January 2004. He joined General Electric Medical Systems in April 1984 and moved progressively towards his current role. He holds a Bachelor of Science Degree in Business Administration and a Master's of Science Degree in Industrial Relations from West Virginia University. Mr. Chini, you are one of the few individuals I have had an opportunity to meet whose name has probably been butchered more than mine. The great thing is you know who knows you and who does not, right? It is harder for them to walk in and think that they can schmooze you, get a job, and say, hey, Chini, you and me, good buddies, remember. Doesn't work, does it? Next we will hear from Mr. Daniel Nelson who is a graduate of the United States Naval Academy. After graduation, he served as an Infantry Officer in the United States Marine Corps. After earning a Graduate Degree from George Washington University, he began to work for Mobil in 1976 in the supply and trading areas. He was elected as an officer of the Exxon Mobil Corporation on June 1, 2004, and at the time assumed his current position as head of Exxon Mobil's Washington Office which is responsible for the company's federal government relations activities as well as its international public affairs group based in Washington. We will then hear from Mr. John Shook who is the Regional Director for Human Resources for BNSF Railway Company. He served in the United States Air Force from July 1968 until October 1993, when he retired as a Lieutenant Colonel. He has worked at BNSF since of October of 1994. We will also, if they are not able to be here, we were to hear today from Mr. Harold Scott who joined Harley-Davidson Motor Company in 2000 as Vice President of Human Resources. He was responsible for all human resources activities including organization development, compensation benefits, employee relations, diversity recruiting, placement training, and labor relations. If Mr. Scott does not make it, I will have his written testimony submitted for the record. Let us first begin, Mr. Donovan, you are now recognized. STATEMENTS OF DENNIS DONOVAN, EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT OF HUMAN RESOURCES, HOME DEPOT; WILLIAM J. BEHRENDT, ASSISTANT VICE PRESIDENT OF HUMAN RESOURCES, UNION PACIFIC; MARC CHINI, VICE PRESIDENT OF HUMAN RESOURCES, GENERAL ELECTRIC INFRASTRUCTURE; DANIEL NELSON, VICE PRESIDENT, EXXON MOBILE CORPORATION; JOHN SHOOK, REGIONAL DIRECTOR OF HUMAN RESOURCES, BNSF RAILWAY COMPANY STATEMENT OF DENNIS DONOVAN MR. DONOVAN. Good morning. My name is Dennis Donovan and I am the Executive Vice President of Human Resources for The Home Depot. THE CHAIRMAN. Mr. Donovan, do you and all members of this panel have written testimony to submit to the Committee? MR. DONOVAN. Yes. THE CHAIRMAN. All have acknowledged in the affirmative. All of your written testimony will be submitted for the record. Hearing no objection, so ordered. Mr. Donovan, you are now recognized. MR. DONOVAN. Thank you. I would like to thank Chairman Steve Buyer and Ranking Member Lane Evans for inviting The Home Depot to participate in this Oversight Hearing on Corporate Commitment to Hiring Veterans. Home Depot is the world's largest home improvement specialty retailer and the second largest retailer in the United States with fiscal 2005 sales of 81.5 billion. The company employs approximately 355,000 associates and has more than 2,000 stores. Our commitment to the men and women who serve our country is unquestionably strong and very close to the heart. Since 2002, we have had approximately 1,800 associates called to active duty for the current Iraqi conflict. The Home Depot has implemented an extended and enhanced leave of absence benefit for our deployed associates. Beyond making sure these associates have a good job when they return home, we equalize pay and extend health benefits to all of our deployed associates and members of their families. Beyond these practices, the Home Depot has been a long-time proponent of hiring separating military, veterans, and military spouses. In September 2004, we joined forces with U.S. Departments of Defense, Labor, and Veterans' Affairs to launch Operation Career Front. This is an unprecedented program designed to provide career opportunities for veterans, separating active-duty servicmembers, National Guard, Reservists, and military spouses. In 2003, the Home Depot hired 10,000 veterans and in 2004, the company hired more than 16,000 former military personnel. And I am very proud to tell you that we hired 17,000 veterans in 2005 as well. The Home Depot has also hired a significant number of former junior military officers into our Store Leadership Program. Since the inception of the program in 2002, the company has enrolled more than 1,200 individuals. Of these, 567 are former junior military officers with 134 of the JMOs being Academy graduates. The company also is a participant in the Marine Corps National Fellows Program. This is a one-year assignment where an officer from the Marine Corps works closely with the company CEO and senior leadership team. Lieutenant Colonel Jim Izen who is here with me today is our fourth Marine Corps fellow. Jim, would you just stand up to be recognized. The company also collaborates with the military to share best practices. In November of 2005, The Home Depot hosted the Army Strategic Leadership Program for the third consecutive year. More than 25 senior officers and personnel were in Atlanta to meet with our Chairman and CEO, Bob Nardelli, as well as members of the senior leadership team to share ideas around leadership, logistics, information technology, and supply chain management. Giving back to the community is one of our company's core values. In 2003, we launched Project Home Front, a program designed to help military families with home repairs while their loved ones were away serving on active duty. The company pledged $1 million and one million volunteer hours and completed more than 1,000 home repairs. In July 2004, the company donated a million dollars in tools and materials to support U.S. military efforts in Iraq. And in November 2005, we made a $250,000 donation to the USO to assist with the refurbishment of ten USO centers. I would like to close by saying that we view our support for the military as our responsibility to this country. We do not view this as a cost, but rather a valuable investment in our company's future. Again, this is something we take very seriously and we will continue to support those who are defending our rights and protecting our freedoms. Chairman Buyer and Ranking Member Evans, thank you again for inviting The Home Depot to participate in this Oversight Hearing on Corporate Commitment to Hiring Veterans. THE CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much. [The statement of Dennis Donovan appears on p. 42] THE CHAIRMAN. Mr. Behrendt, you are now recognized. STATEMENT OF WILLIAM J. BEHRENDT MR. BEHRENDT. Good morning, Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee. My name is Bill Behrendt. I am an Assistant Vice President of Human Resources for Union Pacific Railroad headquartered in Omaha, Nebraska. I have been with the company since 1979, and my current responsibilities include direction of Union Pacific's hiring efforts on a system-wide basis. Before talking about our hiring efforts, I thought a little background about our company would be appropriate. Union Pacific Railroad is one of the leading transportation companies in America. The railroad's 32,400 miles of track links together 23 states and the western two-thirds of the United States and serves the fastest-growing U.S. population centers. Union Pacific's diversified business mix includes agricultural products, automobiles and auto parts, chemicals, energy, industrial products, intermodal traffic, and, yes, military equipment to the tune of over 10,000 shipments of military equipment in the year 2005 alone. We offer competitive long-haul routes from all major West Coast and Gulf Coast ports to eastern gateways where we connect with the eastern railroads. We also connect with Canada's rail systems and we are the only railroad serving all six major gateways to Mexico, making us North America's premier rail franchise. And that is all said with respect to",http://www.gpo.gov:80/fdsys/pkg/CHRG-109hhrg27516/pdf/CHRG-109hhrg27516.pdf,http://www.gpo.gov:80/fdsys/pkg/CHRG-109hhrg27516/html/CHRG-109hhrg27516.htm
